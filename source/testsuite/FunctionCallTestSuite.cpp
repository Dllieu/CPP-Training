    // std::bind can't be inlined

    // about boost::function
    // - Function object wrappers will be the size of a struct containing a member function pointer and two data pointers.
    //   The actual size can vary significantly depending on the underlying platform; on 32-bit Mac OS X with GCC, this amounts to 16 bytes,
    //   while it is 32 bytes Windows with Visual C++. Additionally, the function object target may be allocated on the heap,
    //   if it cannot be placed into the small-object buffer in the boost::function object.
    // - Copying function object wrappers may require allocating memory for a copy of the function object target.
    //   The default allocator may be replaced with a faster custom allocator or one may choose to allow the function object wrappers to only store function object targets
    //   by reference (using ref) if the cost of this cloning becomes prohibitive. Small function objects can be stored within the boost::function object itself, improving copying efficiency.
    // - With a properly inlining compiler, an invocation of a function object requires one call through a function pointer.
    //   If the call is to a free function pointer, an additional call must be made to that function pointer (unless the compiler has very powerful interprocedural analysis).

    // The cost of boost::function can be reasonably consistently measured at around 20ns +/- 10 ns on a modern >2GHz platform versus directly inlining the code.
    // However, the performance of your application may benefit from or be disadvantaged by boost::function depending on how your C++ optimiser optimises.
    // Similar to a standard function pointer, differences of order of 10% have been noted to the benefit or disadvantage of using boost::function to call a function
    // that contains a tight loop depending on your compilation circumstances.

    // about std::function (short version)
    // - store different types of callable objects. Hence, it must perform some type-erasure magic for the storage. Generally, this implies a dynamic memory allocation (by default through a call to new).
    //   the standard encourages implementations to avoid the dynamic memory allocation for small objects
    // - std::function is not an alternative to templates, but rather a tool for design situations where templates cannot be used
    // - One such use case arises when you need to resolve a call at run-time by invoking a callable object that adheres to a specific signature, but whose concrete type is unknown at compile-time.
    //   This is typically the case when you have a collection of callbacks of potentially different types, but which you need to invoke uniformly;
    //   the type and number of the registered callbacks is determined at run-time based on the state of your program and the application logic. Some of those callbacks could be functors,
    //   some could be plain functions, some could be the result of binding other functions to certain arguments

    // tl;dr : never use bind, always use lambda, or use transparent operator functor
    //       - std::function does have an overhead, always use template for the signature except if no choice

    // About lambda capture
    // Each variable expressly named in the capture list is captured.
    // The default capture will only capture variables that are both not expressly named in the capture list and used in the body of the lambda expression.
    // If a variable is not expressly named and you don't use the variable in the lambda expression, then the variable is not capture

    // When calling a ( non - inline ) function, the compiler has to place the function parameters / arguments in a location where the called function will expect to find them.In some cases,
    // it will 'push' the arguments onto the process / thread's stack. In other cases, cpu registers might be assigned to specific arguments. Then, the "return address",
    // or the address following the called function is pushed on the stack so that the called function will know how to return control back to the caller.
    
    // Inline only along hot paths. Excessive inlining bloats executables. Can decrease I-Cache, TLB, and paging effectiveness.
